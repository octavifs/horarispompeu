# horarispompeu

Django app that enables users to create their own timetables by selecting any combination of ESUP subjects and creating a custom iCalendar (.ics) file that can be subscribed from Google Calendar and synchronized from any computer or mobile device. The django app also updates the calendar with new events automatically, so you will never be caught off guard.


## Supported faculties
So far, only 3 degrees by the ESUP are supported:

- Grau en Enginyeria de Sistemes Audiovisuals
- Grau en Enginyeria de Telemàtica
- Grau en Enginyeria en Informàtica

The database schema should be flexible enough so that adding new degrees and faculties is an easy task.
